A square (food) will randomly appear on the screen to be "added"
with the directed circle.
If you hit it, the number of score will increase by one.
The more hits, the more enemy circles will appear.
In the meantime, we also count the time.
If the enemy ball collides with the directed ball, the game is over,
the results are displayed on the screen.
